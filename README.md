# Title: Data Science Challenge

## Challenge description:
#### Task: Predict Housing Prices Using a Simple Linear Regression Model

#### Objective: 
Develop a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The model should be trained, evaluated, and used to make predictions all within a single script.
Requirements:

-    Single File: All code (data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction) must be contained within a single file, such as predict_housing.py or predict_housing.ipynb.
-    Dataset:
        Use the Boston Housing dataset available on Kaggle.
        The script should include code to download and load the dataset directly from the provided URL.
-    Data Preprocessing:
        Handle any missing data appropriately.
        Perform necessary feature scaling or normalization.
        Optionally, create new features that might improve the model's performance.
-    Model Development:
        Implement a simple linear regression model using a library like Scikit-learn.
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
        Train the model on the training set.
-    Model Evaluation:
        Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
        Output the evaluation metrics in a readable format.
-    Prediction:
        Use the trained model to predict housing prices for a few sample data points provided in the script.
        Print out the predicted prices alongside the actual prices for comparison.
-    Documentation:
        Comment your code to explain each step.
        Include a brief summary at the end of the script describing the model's performance and any insights gained.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

-    Functionality: Does the script load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions as specified?
-    Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to read? Are the steps clearly documented?
-    Model Performance: How well does the model perform on the test set? Are the evaluation metrics reasonable given the simplicity of the model?
-    Insight: Does the user demonstrate understanding of the model's results and provide meaningful insights?

#### Submission: 
Submit a single file containing your solution (e.g., predict_housing.py, predict_housing.ipynb).
